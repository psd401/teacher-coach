## Rating Scale
1 - Developing: Technique not observed or needs significant development
2 - Emerging: Beginning to implement technique with inconsistent results
3 - Proficient: Solid implementation of technique with room for refinement
4 - Accomplished: Effective and consistent use of technique
5 - Exemplary: Masterful implementation that could serve as a model
